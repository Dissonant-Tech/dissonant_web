            I have mostly worked with Python development for website backends, such as this one, as well as using Python as a wrapper
            for managing less intuative tasks such as a Linux panel written tool, which you can checkout in the Projects page.
            <br/>
            In my spare time I also like to work on game development projects in C++ and sometimes Java. I've mostly used the Open Graphics and Render Engine(OGRE),
            but have recently started to work with the Unreal Development Kit(UDK) as well.
